## Homework Assignment #12: Object Oriented Programming.

### What is object oriented programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

### Why would you use it?
OOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to package together data states and functionality to modify those data states, while keeping the details hidden away. As a result, code with OOP design is flexible, modular, and abstract. This makes it particularly useful when you create larger programs. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency. 

### In which cases would an OOP pattern be a better choice?
OOP pattern is suitable when application has to perform CRUD functionalities. Specially, use of OOP pattern to pass data back and forth between front-end application and back-end scripts. This helps to maintain modularity of the code and allows to identify which of data interacts with the application.
